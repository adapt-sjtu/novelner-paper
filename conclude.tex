\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present a novel multi-channel BiLSTM-CRF model for emerging named entity recognition in social media messages. 
We find that BiLST-CRF architecture with our proposed comprehensive word representations built from multiple information are effective to overcome the noisy and short nature of social media messages.
