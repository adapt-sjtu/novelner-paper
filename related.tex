Conditional random field (CRF) is a most effective approaches (Lafferty et al., 2001; McCallum
and Li, 2003; Settles, 2004) for NER and other sequence labeling tasks and it achieves the state-of-the-art performance in Twitter NER (Baldwin et al., 2015). 
Whereas, it often needs lots of hand-craft features.

 
More recently, Huang et al. (2015) introduced a more complex model based on bidirectional LSTM could also take into account hand-crafted features.
